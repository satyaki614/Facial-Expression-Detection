# Facial-Expression-Detection
This is my final year project.
The project is based on deep learning.I have used keras which is an open-source neural-network library written in Python.
It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. 
It is designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.
I have used kaggle dataset for training and validation of datasets.You can find the dataset below:

I have mainly used 5 types of expressions for this project:
1.Angry
2.Happy
3.Neutral
4.Sad 
5.Surprise
This is a realtime emotion detection using CNN(Convolutional Neural Network).
